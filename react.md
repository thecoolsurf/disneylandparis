## Install NVM

Node Version Manager (NVM), as the name implies, is a tool for managing Node versions on your device.
Different projects on your device may be using different versions of Node. Using only one version (the one installed by npm) for these different projects may not give you accurate execution results.

#### Run NVM installer
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

#### Update your profile configuration
```
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

#### Reload shell configuration
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Confirm NVM installation by running
```
nvm -v
```

#### Install Node versions
```
nvm install latest
# or
nvm install vX.Y.Z
```

#### Confirm Node installation by running
```
node -v
```
